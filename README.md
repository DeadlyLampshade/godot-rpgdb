# Radical Plugin: Godot Database Manager (RPGDB)
An easy to use JSON database-manager for Godot. **(PRE-ALPHA)** (Compatible with Godot 2.1.3)

## What is it's purpose?
When your programming an RPG, or a strategy game or whatever, you're going to require **a lot of data.** You can either create it in the script files, which is very hard to keep track of, or use the Godot means of creating resources with exported scripts, but there are **limits** to what you can export to Godots inspector. 

The third option is to create a plugin yourself to handle the data and load it at runtime. But with this plugin, **you won't even need to.**

Radical Plugin is a database which is intended to be an easy-to-use, centralized method of creating the databases for whatever project you're working on, with plans to make it completely extensible further down the line.

This is so you don't have to worry about scripting data management systems and back to the fun part: making the game of your dreams.

## How do you use it?

Simply drag the "godot-rpgdb" folder from this project to your projects "res://addon/" folder, and go to Scene>Project Settings and activate the plugin. 

To start editing the databases: Click the "Start RPGDB", and then press the "Edit Database" button on the Popup.
